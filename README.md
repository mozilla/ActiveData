## Use it now!

ActiveData is a service! You can certainly setup your own service, but it is easier to use Mozilla's!

	curl -XPOST -d "{\"from\":\"unittest\"}" http://activedata.allizom.org/query

## Requirements

* Python2.7 installed
* Elasticsearch **version 1.7.x**


### Elasticsearch Configuration

Elasticsearch has a configuration file at `config/elasticsearch.yml`. You must modify it to turn on scripting.  Add these two lines at the top of the file:

    script.inline: on
    script.indexed: on

We enable compression for faster transfer speeds

    http.compression: true

And it is a good idea to give your cluster a unique name so it does not join others on your local network

	cluster.name: lahnakoski_dev

Then you can run Elasticsearch:
 
    c:\elasticsearch>bin\elasticsearch

Elasticsearch runs off port 9200. Test it is working 

	curl http://localhost:9200

you should expect something like 

	{
	  "status" : 200,
	  "name" : "dev",
	  "cluster_name" : "lahnakoski_dev",
	  "version" : {
	    "number" : "1.7.5",
	    "build_hash" : "00f95f4ffca6de89d68b7ccaf80d148f1f70e4d4",
	    "build_timestamp" : "2016-02-02T09:55:30Z",
	    "build_snapshot" : false,
	    "lucene_version" : "4.10.4"
	  },
	  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
	}



## Installation

It is still too early for PyPi install, so please clone *master* off of github:

    git clone https://github.com/klahnakoski/ActiveData.git
    git checkout master

and install your requirements:

    pip install -r requirements.txt


## Configuration

The ActiveData service requires a configuration file that will point to the
default Elasticsearch index. You can find a few sample config files in
`resources/config`. `simple_settings.json` is simplest one:

```javascript
    {
        "flask":{
             "host":"0.0.0.0",
             "port":5000,
             "debug":false,
             "threaded":true,
             "processes":1
         },
        "constants":{
            "pyLibrary.env.http.default_headers":{"From":"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/Projects/ActiveData"}
        },
        "elasticsearch":{
            "host":"http://localhost",
            "port":9200,
            "index":"unittest",
            "type":"test_result",
            "debug":true
        }
        ...<snip>...
    }
```

The `elasticsearch` property must be updated to point to a specific cluster,
index and type. It is used as a default, and to find other indexes by name.

## Run

Jump to your git project directory, set your `PYTHONPATH` and run `app.py`:

```bash
    cd ~/ActiveData
    export PYTHONPATH=.
    python active_data/app.py --settings=resources/config/simple_settings.json
```

## Verify

If you have no records in your Elasticsearch cluster, then you must add some before you can query them.

Make a table in Elasticsearch, with one record: 

    curl -XPUT "http://localhost:9200/movies/movie/1" -d "{\"name\":\"The Parent Trap\",\"released\":\"29 July` 1998\",\"imdb\":\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120783/\",\"rating\":\"PG\",\"director\":{\"name\":\"Nancy Meyers\",\"dob\":\"December 8, 1949\"}}"

Assuming you used the defaults, you can verify the service is up if you can
access the Query Tool at [http://localhost:5000/tools/query.html](http://localhost:5000/tools/query.html).
You may use it to send queries to your instance of the service. For example:

```javascript
    {"from":"movies"}
```

## Tests

The Github repo also included the test suite, and you can run it against
your service if you wish. **The tests will create indexes on your
cluster which are filled, queried, and destroyed**

```bash
    cd ~/ActiveData
    export PYTHONPATH=.
    # OPTIONAL, TEST_SETTINGS already defaults to this file
    export TEST_SETTINGS=tests/config/test_simple_settings.json
    python -m unittest discover -v -s tests
```
